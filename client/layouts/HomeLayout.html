			<h2>Abstract</h2>
			<p>We come across various types of problems in our surrounding environment on a day to day basis, be it minor or a major problem. But most of us tend to ignore them believing that we are not responsible for it, or we don’t suffer from this particular problem or, we don’t have the required skills or resources to solve it. There are also people who love to make things, to help the society and some even want to improve their software / hardware / project development skills but they don’t have any idea about the starting point or can’t identify problems that they can solve with their skills.
This led us to work on a project called “Collaborator”. The main aim of this project is to connect the questions with the solutions, the curious with the knowledgeable and the thinker with the skilled professionals who can execute his / her idea. “Collaborator” provides a platform for the users to post problems which the society faces in general and solving it would bring great relief to the people suffering from it. Users can post problems specific to a particular category to find answers from people well versed in them. The problems can be related to Environment, clothing / textiles, commerce and trade, travel and transport, security, science / technology, energy, family / community/society, health care, education, psychological and many other fields. The platform users can ‘upvote’ a problem if they feel the necessity of solving the problem or themselves have been suffering from a similar problem. The users can even ‘downvote’ a problem if they think that it has already been solved or it’s just a personal problem or they don’t agree if it’s a problem which needs to be solved. 
Users also have the facility to post solutions to the problems already posted on the platform. They can ‘upvote’ or ‘downvote’ a solution depending on their view of the feasibility of the solution. The solutions with the most positive votes will be seen at the top for each problem. The platform also provides users with an opportunity to collaborate and work on projects / solutions with like-minded people. It can help people with a particular skill set meet others who can complement their skills in order to accomplish the mission of the project. For example, a designer can find a developer and vice-versa. It can also help researchers, students, entrepreneurs, companies and individuals find problems in the society which they can solve.
